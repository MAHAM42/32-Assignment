// ASSIGNMENT NO 32:

/*
Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that 
everyone has a unique username.

• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. 
Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used.
 If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username.
  If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

• Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
